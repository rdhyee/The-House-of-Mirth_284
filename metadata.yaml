description: "The House of Mirth (1905), a novel by Edith Wharton (1862–1937), tells\
  \ the story of Lily Bart, a well-born but impoverished woman belonging to New York\
  \ City’s high society around the turn of the last century. Wharton creates a portrait\
  \ of a ravishing beauty who, though raised and educated to marry well both socially\
  \ and economically, is reaching her 29th year, an age when her marital prospects\
  \ are becoming ever more limited. The House of Mirth traces Lily’s slow two-year\
  \ social descent from privilege to a tragically lonely existence on the margins\
  \ of society. Wharton uses Lily as an attack on \"an irresponsible, grasping and\
  \ morally corrupt upper class\"(309-310).\nBefore publication as a book on October\
  \ 14, 1905, The House of Mirth was serialized in Scribner’s Magazine beginning in\
  \ January 1905. It attracted a readership among housewives and businessmen alike.\
  \ Charles Scribner wrote Edith in November 1905 that the novel was showing \"the\
  \ most rapid sale of any book ever published by Scribner.\"(310) By the end of December\
  \ sales had reached 140,000 copies. Edith's royalties were valued at more than half\
  \ a million dollars in today's currency. The commercial and critical success of\
  \ The House of Mirth solidified Wharton's reputation as a major novelist.\nBecause\
  \ of the novel's commercial success some critics classified it as a genre novel.\
  \ However, Edith's pastor, then rector of Trinity Church in Manhattan, wrote to\
  \ tell her that her novel was \"a terrible but just arraignment of the social misconduct\
  \ which begins in folly and ends in moral and spiritual death.\"(310) This moral\
  \ purpose was not lost on the literary reviewers and critics of the time who tended\
  \ to categorize it as both social satire and a novel of manners. Carol Singley in\
  \ her Introduction to Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth: A Case Book states, \"\
  [The House of Mirth] is a unique blend of romance, realism, and naturalism,[and\
  \ thus] transcends the narrow classification of a novel of manners.\"(3) The House\
  \ of Mirth was Edith Wharton's second published novel and was preceded by two novellas,\
  \ The Touchstone (1900), Sanctuary (1903) and one full-length novel, The Valley\
  \ of Decision (1902). Her subsequent important novels are Ethan Frome (1911), The\
  \ Custom of the Country (1913), and The Age of Innocence (1920) for which she won\
  \ the Pulitzer Prize in 1921. These works influenced a host of American authors\
  \ for two generations. They include F. Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby),Sinclair\
  \ Lewis (Main Street),John O'Hara (Appointment in Samarra), and Louis Auchincloss\
  \ (The House of Five Talents).\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
